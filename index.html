                <h3>Who are you??</h3>
                <p>I'm glad you asked, name's Maja, also known as "The™ J", or just "J", but you can call me Majka or Majcia :3. 
                <br>I'm a 14 year old <span class="gr">(born in 2010 <span class="sg">💀</span>)</span> bisexual trans girl <span class="gr">(she/her)</span> aaand I'm from Poland <span class="gr">(who would've guessed)</span>.</p>
                As every trans girl that exists, I like programming, out of all the programming languages, I'm currently learning:
                <br><span class="sg">(sarcasm ^)</span>
                <ul>
                    <li> GDScript (Godot, Hobby)                                                                </li>
                    <li> Python (School, <span class="linetr">Hobby</span>)                                     </li>
                    <li> C (Arduino, School)                                                                    </li>
                    <li> C++ (School)                                                                           </li>

                <br><h3>Ok, that's cool and all, but where did "The™ J" nickname come from?</h3>
                    <span class="sg">(I added this just because I got asked what's the reasoning of my username like 8 times)</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <p>"The™" is just a prefix I took from "**The™** Hideout" (a groupchat I am in), the "™" after "The" originated from of us not knowing what to name our server, <br> which lead to an argument and I placed a trademark symbol next to "Hideout", making it into "The Hideout™️" but someone else took it and missplaced it, making it come out as "The™️ Hideout"</p>  </li>
                        <li> <p>"J" also originates from "The™ Hideout", people there didnt know how to pronounce my earlier nickname ("Jankeczek"<span class="sg">, Polish language moment</span>), so they jokingly asked me to change the nickname to "J",<br> so they could read it more easiely. While I firstly I also jokingly set my nickname to "J", I started rolling with it, because it seemed nice and it evolved to "The™️ J"</p>                                  </li>
                        <li> <p>thing, as "Jankeczek" comes from Jan <span class="gr">(my guy-name)</span> you can make the abbreviation that it comes from Maja <span class="gr">(my girl-name)</span>  and thet "the m" and "the a" didnt stick to me.<br> Though I dont really have a big of a problem with my guy-name, so I dont really care, at least not right now</p>                                                                          </li>
