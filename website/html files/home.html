                <br>And also, I'm from Poland<span class="sg dissapear"> (again, who would've guessed)</span>.</p>
                As every transfem that exists<span class="sg dissapear"> (sarcasm)</span>, I like programming,
                <br>out of all the programming languages that exist - I'm currently learning: 
                <ul>
                    <li> GDScript [Godot, Hobby]  </li>
                    <li> Python [School<span class="dissapear">, </span><span class="linetr dissapear">Hobby</span>]  </li>

                <h3>Likes:</h3>
                <p>In general I like/am interested in a lot of stuff, for example,
                <br>I, Fucking, LOVE <i>PUBLIC <b>TRANSPORT.</b></i> -
                <br>- Please give me as much trams and buses and trains and Oh God. I love them.</p>
                <p>On another note - I also like practically everything connected to computers.
                <ol id="nobullet">
                    <li>Programming? ‚úÖ<br></li>
                    <li>the inner workings of computers? ‚úÖ<span class="sg dissapear"><br>(I forgot what it's named in English üò≠)</span><br></li>
                    <li>Operating systems? ‚úÖ<br></li>
                    <li>How the internet works? ‚úÖ<br></li>
                    <li>I'd say that pixelart is connected to computers and I'm learning it so hey, <br> Pixelart? ‚úÖ</li>
                </ol>
                If you told me something about computers, I would probably get more or less interested in it.</p>
                <p>If you were to ask me what song do I like the most,
                <br>it'd probably be <b style="color: rgb(0, 162, 255);">"Kaloryfer"</b> by <span style="color:aqua;">≈Åona i Webber</span>,
                <br>but if you were to ask me what music artist do I like the most,
                <br>it'd probably be <span style="color:aqua;">≈Åona i Webber</span>, but <span style="color: green;">Dawid Podsiad≈Ço</span> would be second.
